            <p>The website that has been offered as the prototype for the tender request meets each of the requirements specified by Tree-Shrew Publishing. The visual design of the website is simple, yet elegant, portraying class and professionalism. The aim is to convey to visitors of the website a feeling of sophistication. The website is built using HTML5, and the structural design, that is, the structure of the HTML mark-up, adheres to the standards set by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). This essentially means that each page of the website has been created using the correct logical structure, by using the appropriate HTML5 tags, while keeping the styling of the web page to a separate CSS file. In addition to adhering to web standards, the website also adheres to the accessibility standards set by the W3C. While a lot of this accessibility is achieved through the correct logical structuring of each page, certain attributes have been included in the associated HTML tags to ensure that the web site is accessible to people of all types.</p>

            <p>In addition to adhering to the above standards, the website has been designed to be responsive to all devices, including being print optimised. This ensures that the content of the website will transform dynamically, depending on what size of device is viewing the content. Though the content transforms dynamically, it does not lose any of the information that is being conveyed or reduce the usability of the website, ensuring that people will receive the same experience regardless of what device they view the website on. In addition to this each web page has been optimised for print form should the user decide they want to print a certain page. The end result being that the prototype website presented meets all the functional requirements specified by Tree-Shrew Publishing, while conveying the company and associated information in a light that conveys elegance, professionalism and usability. It is my belief that should the contract be awarded to myself, the design can be further expanded upon and refined to ensure that Tree-Shrew Publishing is represented on the web in a stylish, accessible and usable manner.</p>

            <h3 id="report1">1. Site Design</h3>
            <p>The goal when creating the website for Tree-Shrew Publishing was to create a visual design that conveyed a sense of simple sophistication, elegance and professionalism. This was achieved through the use of darker colours as the primary colour scheme, while keeping the text a crisp white to ensure readability. The layout of the site is simple, with information being offset by images or borders to reduce the impact of large blocks of text. Header images are present on each page to provide an impactful entry to each page, while also acting as a form of memory trigger for users to more easily recall the pages they have visited. Images have primarily been used to spice up the background of each page, to ensure that the content does not appear dull. The pages for each individual author are quite long, therefore a fixed, back to top icon has been implemented to allow the user to return to the top of the page with a single click. This ensures the user does not feel stranded in a mass of information halfway down a long page. The site has been designed to be usable on all devices and the visual design follows accessibility standards to ensure that users of all types are able to use the site successfully. Details on these aspects are discussed in following sections.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="report-section">
            <h3 id="report2">2. Standards and Accessibility</h3>
            <p>The website has been created to adhere to the standards set by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) for both accessibility and logical structure. The correct HTML tags have been used in the structure of each page to represent the information they are conveying. Meta data is present in the head tag of each page to specify the language, viewport and character set being used. The general flow of each page is a header, followed by the main content, which is broken into logical sections and their associated content, and at the end of each page a footer is present. Care has been taken to ensure that the semantic meaning of the structure is conveyed successfully through HTML tags, and that the styling for the website is kept completely separate from the logical structure.</p>

            <p>Accessibility standards have also been kept in mind during the creation of the website. While having a good logical structure goes a long way towards improving the accessibility of the website, certain elements and HTML attributes have been included to ensure that the website is accessible to all users. Hyperlinks are incredibly important to the overall navigation of the website. As such, they are represented with an underline, change colour on visit and hover, and have a tooltip display when hovering. This ensures that users are able to differentiate a link from standard text in a variety of circumstances. While the site has been designed to be visual, care has been taken to include the alt attribute on all images, with a meaningful description. This attribute allows the image to be represented by a text equivalent of what the image represents. This ensures that users who are unable to display images, or are using a screen reader will still be able to receive the information that the images are conveying. In a more general sense, navigation elements have been kept simple, quotations have been enclosed in the appropriate HTML tags, accessibility attributes have been used where appropriate and the overall usability of the website on varying devices has been kept in mind during the creation. Each of these aspects all contribute to the accessibility of the website. As mentioned earlier the logical structure of the website goes a long way to ensuring accessibility. Therefore, adhering to the standards of HTML5 set by the W3C ensures that the website has been designed to be accessible and usable to all users. The next section will discuss the responsiveness of the website and overall usability on different devices.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="report-section">
            <h3 id="report3">3. Responsiveness</h3>
            <p>In this day and age where there are so many different devices each of which is able to browse the web and view websites in some manner, it is vitally important to ensure that websites are built to be responsive. Responsiveness essentially means that the website dynamically changes to best suit the size display being used to view it, ensuring a usable site on any device. This is exactly what has been achieved with the Tree-Shrew Publishing website. This responsiveness falls into a form of accessibility, so essentially links back to the previous section on standards and accessibility. Though justifies a section to itself to explain how it has been achieved.</p>

            <p>The site has been created to have four points of change. Each point of change is specified in a CSS rule in the stylesheet. This rule dictates at what size or resolution to implement the associated styling. In the case of Tree-Shrew Publishing, this has been set at four different screen widths. At each point of change the website's content dynamically changes to best fit the screen. For example, a user viewing the website on a mobile phone will see a differently positioned navigation bar, and certain background images will not be displayed due to lack of screen space. However, the core content of the website will have been scaled to fit this device, and as such the user will receive the exact same content as those viewing the site on a larger display. The primary changes that take place are navigation bar positioning and styling, content alignment, and image display. In addition to standard responsiveness, print formatting has also been implemented. This ensures that pages are able to be printed free of any unnecessary visual content, such as colours, images and page formatting.</p>
