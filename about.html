            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p class="intro-paragraph">Tree-Shrew Publishing is an independent publishing house located in inner-city Melbourne, Australia and has been providing a specifically tailored service to authors since 1960. Tree-Shrew Publishing specialises in publishing works of fiction, both for adults and children. Though this is our speciality we do not turn down other nonfiction works, having published both works of history and biographies. Having been in the industry for so many years we have been exposed to a number of authors from many different backgrounds and seen the rise and fall of an even greater number of trends within the fiction sector of the industry. However, in spite of how the industry changes, Tree-Shrew Publishing stays committed to providing the emerging or established author with excellence in service. It is Tree-Shrew Publishing's mission to provide an environment that authors from all backgrounds can flourish in. It is our philosophy that creative brilliance is achieved by being part of a professional, yet supportive environment that nurtures and encourages fresh and exciting ideas, free from the shackles of editorial control. With these philosophies in mind, Tree-Shrew Publishing is committed to supplying the facilities as well as business acumen to help emerging authors reach not only new heights of creative brilliance, but also commercial success.</p>
